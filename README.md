## Task 4: Prototype to Showcase AI Solution

For the prototype I trained a model in Azure Custom Vision to identify the type of car.

I added 4 categories of vehicles in the Custom Vision.
- Sedan
- Hatchback
- SUV
- Pickup-truck

Here the Custom Vision AI is accessed via the API in a React Vite project.
